# Advanced Dimensionality Reduction Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains three Google Colab notebooks and their corresponding demonstrations for the **Advanced Dimensionality Reduction** course assignment. The assignment showcases various dimensionality reduction techniques applied to different datasets, including image, tabular, and medical datasets.

### Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Covered:
1. **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**
2. **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**
3. **ISOMAP**
4. **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**
5. **MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling)**
6. **Randomized PCA**
7. **Kernel PCA**
8. **Incremental PCA**
9. **Factor Analysis**
10. **Autoencoders**
